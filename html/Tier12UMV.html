With the discount, the catalyst<br/> amount gets cut in half, meaning 7,376.5\u00a7 L of ca<br/>talyst, which are rounded to 7,376L, and due to th<br/>e 64A UMV the machine is supplied with the recipe <br/>overclocks 3 times, meaning each recipe actually u<br/>ses 36,484,545,600 * 2^3 = 291,876,364,800 EU. \n\nK<br/>nowing the amount of OCs and the base voltage of t<br/>he recipe, the difference of the needed EU per rec<br/>ipe with and without perfect OC can be calculated,<br/> that being 291,876,364,800 - 36,484,545,600 = 255<br/>,391,819,200 extra EU due to imperfect OCs.\nTo get<br/> the value of needed extra catalyst, this extra EU<br/> value has to be divided by the energy density of <br/>the relevant catalyst, prosaic in this case.\n\nThe <br/>division equates to 255,391,819,200 EU / 66,768,46<br/>0 EU/L = 3,825.037 L, rounded to 3,825L extra pros<br/>aic catalyst per recipe. For the final step, this <br/>value has to be multiplied by 0.5 as its affected <br/>by the discount, meaning the total extra catalyst <br/>that gets added to the recipe is 3,825L * 0.5 = 1,<br/>912.5 L, rounded to 1,912L.\n\nTo summarise it all i<br/>n a formula:\nAmount extra catalyst per recipe = (B<br/> * ((2^x) - 1))/2L\nwhere:\nB is base total EU of th<br/>e recipe\nx is the number of overclocks\nL is the EU<br/>/L of the relevant catalyst [/note]\n"
